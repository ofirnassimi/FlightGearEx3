In order to use the program you must download all of the related files attached in the git link. Once you have installed all of the necessary files, create a text file including the commands you'd like the simulator will do (possible commands include: Print, openDataServer, connectControlClient, Sleep, var, if and while), save it in the project's file and write the file's name as an argument (for example: name.txt).
## Operating
Once you have installed all of the necessary files, create a text file including the commands you'd like the simulator will do (possible commands include: Print, openDataServer, connectControlClient, Sleep, var, if and while), save it in the project's file and write the file's name as an argument (for example: name.txt). Now you can run the program and then turn on the simulator and click on fly!
The simulator will now follow the instuction in your textfile. enjoy!
